# HR Metrics Automator

**Project:** `hr-metrics-automator`  
**Purpose:** Automate HR KPI reporting from monthly operational metrics into an executive-ready PowerPoint deck.

---

## Overview

This project simulates a production-style HR dashboard automation workflow:

1. Generates realistic monthly HR metrics (12 months: **Feb 2025 – Jan 2026**)
2. Calculates trend insights and month-over-month changes
3. Produces a polished **5-slide executive PowerPoint** report
4. Outputs supporting visualizations and summary text for fast stakeholder review

Designed as a portfolio artifact for **HR Analytics / HRIS / People Ops** roles.

## Professional Project Description

**HR Metrics Automator** is an executive reporting automation solution for People Operations teams that need fast, consistent, and decision-ready workforce insights.

Instead of manually pulling metrics into slide decks each month, this project automates the full reporting pipeline: data generation/ingestion, KPI analysis, charting, executive summary writing, and PowerPoint delivery. The result is a repeatable reporting process that improves leadership visibility into hiring health, retention risk, and department-level workforce dynamics.
